Developed an intelligent task management system using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and a SQLite database. The system allows users to add, view, and manage tasks via both speech and text input interfaces, providing a seamless interaction with the user. Utilized NLP techniques for speech recognition and command processing, enabling users to perform tasks like creating, updating, and deleting tasks through voice commands. The project is designed to be extensible, with plans to integrate Machine Learning (ML) models in the future for intelligent task prioritization and smart suggestions, improving the user experience and task management efficiency.
